Codebook for Peer Assessment Activity - Getting and Cleaning Data - Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

- The data are from a study of human movement using a smartphone as a motion detector. Description of study and how the data were obtained can be found here:

- Here is an excerpt from the study that describes the data:

“The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.”

- The dataset tidydata.txt is an aggregated subset of the original data, where any mean and standard deviation variables have been averaged for each participant and activity.

- The variables in tidydata.txt are as follows:

	SubjectID - integer id of the test or train subject

	Activity - self descriptive string describing the activity of the subject when the data where obtained

	ActivityCode - integer id of code associated with the activity:

		1 WALKING
		2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		4 SITTING
		5 STANDING
		6 LAYING

	(the following are described at the beginning of this document)

	tBodyAcc-XY, or Z - mean or std - aggregated average for each subject/activity
	tGravityAcc-XY, or Z - mean or std - aggregated average for each subject/activity
